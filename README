The Labelord application is for the replication of GitHub labels. This application uses mainly requests,
 flask and click. You are able to use list_repos, list_labels, run and run_server commands.

If you want to record new cassettes:
1. Write the real GitHub token to 'config.cfg' in tests_unit\fixtures\configs.
2. Set your parameters and outputs in tests_unit/conftest_unit.py
    â€¢for example: REPOS, LABELS, RUN_DRY, TARGET_REPOS
3. Before recording cassettes you have to delete cassettes of mine
